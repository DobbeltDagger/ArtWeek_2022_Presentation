        <section>
          <i>Fermenting Data</i> is a long-term curatorial project engaging in sensing and sense-making with data and fermentation. It is dedicated to reclaiming data as common practice rather than being assigned to statistics, machine learning, and other computational modeling methods.<br/>
          It is an invitation to discover and invent data processing through practice of fermentation. To ferment data is to speculate and create ways to live together as people and others who care.

          ... When performed for Fermenting Data exhibition project, <i>Aarhus Urban Operating System</i> becomes a documentation of the city as it is changing. The project is the audiosphere that replays the physical restructuring of the neighbourhoods in the Gellerup area.<br/>
          Rather than creating the architectural and somewhat utopian view that represents the district after the transition, the artist uses machine learning technologies to register and perform with data how the area with its current inhabitants are affected by these major regeneration plans and works ...

          The future of the modern city is a computational model&mdash;a vast array of vectors extracted from sensors and networked devices inside the city. This future resides in a technological grammar of data, services, protocols, applications and monitoring systems.<br/>
          The promises of computational cities and the implementation of smart city technologies differ significantly. In theory, smart cities are open information infrastructures, that help policy makers rethink and rebuild city services in accordance with citizens’ needs. In reality, it’s a mess: The implementation of smart technologies is the aggregation of data into black boxes, elusive and imbued with political agenda.<br/><br/>
          The Wrocław Urban Operating System takes an interest in the city as computational model. It compiles various digital representations of the city — audio recordings, photos, video and smart city narratives — and utilizes these in a live coding framework, built specifically for this work, to produce an ambient pop music that corresponds with the computational configuration and teletopia of a future Wrocław.
